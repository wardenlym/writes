Big list of Japanese Mahjong terminology
Posted on April 3, 2009 by UmaiKeiki
Yo, this is UmaiKeiki once again. This post comes at the request of MOUIKKAI who wanted some kind of glossary of basic game terms so we can translate stuff.

This probably came about because Osamu and Fukuchi-sensei read each other’s blogs and discovered how English and Japanese abbreviate three-player mahjong:

三人麻雀 = 三麻 (sanma)
3-player mahjong = 3p

I’ll also try to include a list of common English terms that differ from the Japanese. Obviously I can only include the most common words or else this post would never end…


ENGLISH LIST
Here’s a list of commonly used English terms that differ from the Japanese equivalent to some extent. In most cases this is due to the influence of card games like rummy and poker.

dealer	oya (親)	The name Mahjong refers to sparrows, so one person is the Oya (parent), and the others are Ko (children).
walls	yama (山)	Means “mountains”.
dead wall	wanpai (王牌)	Means “royal tiles”. Insert “wang tiles” joke here.
dragons	sangenpai (三元牌)	Means “three elements”. The individual tiles are often referred to by colour in the West because players are not expected to learn the characters.
suit	shoku (色)	Means “colour”.
meld	mentsu (面子)	“Meld” comes from rummy, the card game most closely related to mahjong.
set	koutsu (刻子)	“Set” also comes from rummy; a common alternative is “3 of a kind” from poker.
run	shuntsu (順子)	“Run” comes from rummy; “Straight” from poker.
JAPANESE LIST
Here’s the list of basic game terms in Japanese, with kanji given whenever possible. You probably won’t need many of the kanji, though, as mahjong terms seem to be frequently written in katakana. This list won’t cover yaku names (which you can get here) and slang terms (in which case the list would never end). I’m not a Japanese expert so don’t hesitate to make corrections or suggestions!

Hi! I’m Benjamin. I don’t think we’ve corresponded before, but I’d like to say that I think your blog is really excellent. This entry in particular is a great resource; thanks for taking the time to put it together.

I’ve always wanted to put together a comprehensive list of these but could never get started. In the hopes that you can make one, here’s some additions/corrections:

first section

discard kiru 切る (to cut)
discard area kawa 河　(river)
self-draw tsumoru 積もる (to pile up)

second section

aotenjuu 青天井 *should be aotenjou

ariari アリアリ *rules which allow kuitan and atozuke. Most common basic set of rules in Japan.

atozuke 先付け A rule that allows hands without yaku to Ron if the winning tile would create a yaku. *(This close, but not quite accurate. Playing without atozuke means you can’t claim a tile with a hand that doesn’t *already* have a yaku. So no calling for a shuntsu and *then* claiming a white dragon if that dragon is the only yaku you win on. It gets kinda complicated since if you have the dragon pon in your hand you’re fine even if you drew into it later)

bakahon バカホン Slang for honitsu with no extra yaku. Generally a hand made only by beginners

kawa 河 discard area
kaze hai 風牌 wind tiles

(kanzen) sakizuke（完全）先付け opposite of atozuke

ikasama イカサマ To cheat using sleight of hand, etc.
inchiki インチキ To cheat using hacks, bug exploits, etc. *(These are often used interchangeably. I think that inchiki is cheating in general, whereas ikasama is generally specific to physical mahjong. You rarely hear the latter in other contexts. I’ve heard the former at other game tournaments that didn’t involve computers)

mawashiuchi 回し打ち Attempting to both win a hand and deal only safe tiles. Pretty hard unless you have really good radar. *(is also known as mawasu)

mentanpin メンタンピン Abbreviation for riichi-tanyao-pinfu, a very common set of yaku

nashi nashi ナシナシ　opposite of ari ari

oikakeriichi 追いかけリーチ Riichi roulette. To make a Riichi declaration after someone else rather than defend.　*(I’m pretty sure this is okkake. 追っかけ)

oka オカ bonnus for 1st place

tenpin/tengo/tensan テンピン etc. Monetary rate of exchange in a Mahjong game. These three terms are the most common, 1000 points is converted to 100 yen, 50 yen and 30 yen respectively.

uma ウマ　bonus for people in 1st and 2nd paid at end of game by 4th and 3rd

yamiten 闇テン same as damaten

(pon and chi have kanji as well, although I’m sure you know they’re rarely used)

There are lots more terms out there, but this is everything I could come up with right now. I hope it helps. Keep up the great work!

Why hello there.

Very nice list. At some point I’ll add them in along with some tenhostats terms that Alvin wanted.

Also thanks for the corrections (although Senechal found some first — I’m just lazy.)

I agree that there are lots more terms out there and we probably couldn’t list them all if we tried. I hope we can get a good solid list of the common ones, though.

Here are some more terms (picked up from Saikyo no Mahjong 3D rule settings):

ryanhan shibari 二飜縛り After 5 renchans, a 2 han minimum hand is needed for others to win against the dealer
shaanyuu 西入 If after tonnansen no player has above 30k points, west round is started, with west as round wind
hakoten (dobon) ハコテン （ドポン） Game ends when player or players drop below 0 points
kandora sokunori 積ドラ即乗り Allows flipping of a new dora indicator after calling a kan
tochuu ryuukoku 途中流局 Allows drawing the game in the middle of a round, for example after 4 same wind discards, 4 riichi calls, etc.
karaten カラテン Situation in which a player waits for a tile to finish his hand, but that tile was already discarded 4 times. Depending on rules this can be perceived as no-ten or tenpai. Most often it’s tenpai, since usually tenpai does not take discarded tiles into account.
kiriage mangan 切り上げ満貫 Dunno what it is, I’d like an explanation myself :)

Cheers UmaiKeiki!

Evil Dragon, by name, I’m assuming it is “mangan by approximation.” i.e., 30fu 4han becomes mangan instead of 7700, and such. A few videogames and places use it.

I have some nice ones for the list that I seem to be reading a lot lately:

高目（たかめ、高め、タカメ） takame – The specific tile in a multiple wait that gives you the most points. (11123789m789p78s, the takame would be 9s)

安目（やすめ、安め、ヤスメ） yasume – The specific tile(s) in a multiple wait that gives you the least points. (11123789m789p78s, the yasume would be 6s)

安手（やすで、ヤスデ） yasude – Cheap hand. Literally, and it is what it is.

染め手some-te – A one suit (hon/chin itsu) hand. To “go for one suitters” would be 染める (someru). (Ever wondered why 染谷まこ Mako *Someya* only goes for one suitters?)

Tenpane テンパネ　(If I got this right off the website of the Japanese Mahjong Association… Your hand’s score gets powered up by the resulting fu from the agari. Kinda like, a takame but not because it gives off more fan, but because it gives off more fu. But I’m not a hundred percent sure this is the only or most definite deffinition for this)

I saw fuhane for that last one, but let’s be honest… some concepts in Japanese mahjong don’t exist in the Western World, and others don’t really need to be translated. (that’s why I’m not sure if Tenpane is for the fu breaking over (12 fu … + 20 base + 10 menzen-ron*) or for a hand that can be worth haneman)

xKime on September 4, 2010 at 10:35 pm said:
I’m possitive tenpane is not haneman-wise. This is the explanation for the term:

テンパネとは、加符要素が12符以上あって基本符から2回繰り上がりをすることを指す麻雀用語です。

Which I would translate as, well, what I said up there. Taking advantage of the kiriage (“rounding up”?) of the fu when it becomes 12 instead of 10 to take the hand up a notch or whatnot. I came across this term twice in the same day (in the quiz answers and in the Mahjong Pro Association website) so I decided to throw it in.

If we’re going to be possitive about it, no term needs translation, we could just say “13 orphans… all bumps… three concealed bumps” it’s all translated, really, but knowing terminology means more power to you, IIRC. Yay.

I would say takame and yasume are great and useful terms on their own. How would you go about it? “your best out”? “Your worst out”? Then, I could come from a different region, and ask “what the hell is an ‘out’?”

Also, if you want to understand what the heck the mahjong commentators are saying. In case you do.

まぁ、せやけど、日本語分からへんかったらもっと難しくなんねんでぇ。ええわ。笑

Senjo on September 5, 2010 at 3:10 pm said:
so fuhane and tenpane are the same thing, I don’t have my big glossary list that I was working on to check… there are a lot of terms that say the exact same thing.

I’m not trying to say it’s wrong for say you or me to know what takame, yasume, sannoko or other terms mean. It’s just that a glossary should have a way to separate terms essential to game comprehension, to intermediate knowledge, to advanced language comprehension related to the gaming lexicon. I also trust your knowledge on this, as I’ve browsed your beginner’s guide “The 94 pages of everything a beginner should learn and love about Mahjong” in Spanish, of course, I pretended it was French and just kept reading. (I could still understand 98% of it.)

Except for bump, please don’t use bump in that context (head bump is fine).

xKime on September 6, 2010 at 3:12 am said:
If you say “fuhane” has the same definition, I’ll take your word for it, as I have yet to see the term, and makes a fair amount of sense. (as for fu are just [mini/basic] ten)
These are terms that aren’t even on my mahjong books, so I have to thank the Japanese internetz for finding the terminology for me.

Yeah, I’m well aware this isn’t basic knowledge, hence it’s not in the list but in a comment to it. w
Thank you for reading even though it wasn’t on your native language. While our languages aren’t so different, I can imagine it takes some effort, even if it was on the same language. I’m thinking on translating it to a few more languages, but it already took me a year to do the Spanish version, and I still have to revise it for things I forgot to mention (Pinfu Ron/Pinfu Tsumo scoring, and what happens to the tsumo fu in case of rin shan).

Even though, I find it ironic that “head bump” is alright while “pon” as “bump” isn’t, as the original chinese “peng” does mean bump. I’m not familiar with English terminology (except for the one used in the GameDesign flash game), so I wouldn’t be sure what’s alright and what’s not. I actually thought I saw something like “all bumps” in some English yaku chart somewhere, or I could have imagined it.

Found it on konchan.
てんパネ 点跳ね 　 符ハネのこと
ふハネ 符跳ね 1 符が繰り上がること。点パネ。 「32符は～で40符」 　
2 門前のロンあがりなら50符以上、その他の場合40符以上になること。点パネ。 「自摸のみだけど～だから400・700だね」

Given that, it’s not limited to 40fu (50fu for menzen ron) but that’s the basic threshold. 12 minipoints+ Makes you have to learn at least the second point column, and third. (1300 > 2600 > 5200 > 8000 and 1600 > 3200 > 6400 > 8000)

wareme 割れ目 A rule that doubles any payment involving the player whose wall was broken at the start of the round.

It means exactly as it says. Any payment, wins and losses.

A mangan share would be doubled (2000-2000-4000 becomes either 2000-4000-4000 for 10k or 2000-2000-8000 for 12k if the wall cut on the dealer’s side. If you win a hand and have the wall cut in front of you, then it’s like scoring baiman (4000-4000-8000) for 16k.

You can attempt to aim for rons on a certain player because essentially, you’re doubling the value of the hand (ignoring a haneman ron from player A because it could be worth double (sanbaiman equivalent) from player B.)

That should be clear enough.
